on a specific query string and search configuration options.

The utility also contains the functionality to combine multiple images in a large mosaic image.

This utility was used to search and experiment with bulk image downloads for a given query string. The images where then
used by another project to create multiple HTML bootstrap static galleries, containing multiple images (20+), used in a static web site.
